Automated Reasoning is the study of algorithms and systems that allow computers to reason about 
logical statements. 

In this chapter, we will introduce the syntax and semantics of First-Order Logic (FOL), 
which is the most widely used logic in the field of Automated Reasoning. 

We will also introduce the concept of a \textit{model} and 
the notion of \textit{validity} of a logical statement.

Automated Reasoning is achieved by using symbol reasoning, which is the manipulation of symbols
according to the rules of logic.
